# Project Guess the Book Scripts
Scripts from Guess the Book project - training an AI to guess author names based on symbol frequency of their works.

The scripts work based on Project Gutenberg's library of public domain works. You can download the metadata about the books here: http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs
And the instructions about how to get the actual books here: http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Mirroring_How-To (mirroring the site) and here: http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages (downloading a specific subset of books).

Included scripts:

01_rdf_to_csv.py: 
Takes a path where .rdf/xml files are stored, extracts author names, years of birth & death, and titles of their works, puts them into a Pandas dataframe, and saves them as a .csv file in the location of your choice.

Libraries used:
- rdflib: https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib
- pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org


2. book-meta-analysis.py:
Takes in the .csv generated by rdf-to-csv.py, removes rows with empty cells, and runs basic analysis on each column, and then on several columns for sanity checking.

Libraries you'll need:
- pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org
- matplotlib.pyplot: https://matplotlib.org
- numpy (recommended to import separately from matplotlib): https://www.numpy.org


3. frequentize.py:
Takes a path where .txt files are stored, returns a .csv with grequency tables per .txt file.

Libraries you'll need:
- pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org
